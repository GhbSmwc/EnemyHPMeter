<center><h1>Rounding towards &ldquo;Complete&rdquo; detection</h1></center>

The purpose of this feature is to prevent the bar from misrepresenting the value of something when they get rounded down towards empty or
rounded up to full. Thus, before this was implemented, when used on such things such as a health bar, the meter can display empty when
the character (player or enemy) isn't defeated or dead yet, due to the bar's fill value (number of pieces filled) was
<nobr><tt>0 &lt; NumberOfPiecesFilled &lt; 0.5</tt></nobr> (the amount is in between those two numbers without being in exact), should
there be a low number of pieces and/or high amount of quantities.<br><br>


You may wondering why I rather have the information about the rounding towards empty or full (best to be called &ldquo;complete&rdquo;
for both empty and full) to be as an output of <tt>CalculateGraphicalBarPercentage</tt> subroutine in Y than directly have $00 (amount of fill) set to #$0001 (the fill
amount is 16-bit) or <tt>MaxValue-1</tt>. This is in case if you want to have <i>certain</i> bar(s) with the rounding <i>away</i> from either full or empty,
or if you want to display that it is very close to complete using &ldquo;pseudo extra pieces&rdquo; (these actually do not modify the amount of fill in any form or way):<br>

Use <a target="_blank" href="../ExampleUsage/RoundAwayFromComplete.asm">this code</a> (link break if moved or deleted) as a template when designing such a feature.<br><br>

Just remember that the tile table for each amount of fill graphic, also includes the tiles for near-empty and near-full:
<table><td><pre>GraphicalBar_LeftEnd8x8s:
	;    0   1   2   3 [*]
	db $36,$37,$38,$39,<font color="red">$29</font>
GraphicalBar_Middle8x8s:
	;    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 [*] [*]
	db $55,$56,$57,$58,$59,$65,$66,$67,$68,<font color="red">$2A,$2B</font>
GraphicalBar_RightEnd8x8s:
	;    0   1   2   3 [*]
	db $50,$51,$52,$53,<font color="red">$54</font></pre></td></table><br>
The red colored font (under the &ldquo;<tt>[*]</tt>&rdquo; if you're colorblind) means those are <b>not part</b> of the amount of fill, rather use as a tile substitute when
the bar rounds towards complete. So after executing <tt>CalculateGraphicalBarPercentage</tt> and <tt>DrawGraphicalBar</tt> (you must <tt>PHY...PLY</tt> around the latter), you
do this:
<table><td><pre>	PHY							;>push rounding flag (obviously the following routine overwrites Y)
	JSL GraphicalBarELITE_DrawGraphicalBar			;>get bar values.
	PLY							;>pull rounding flag

	CPY #$00 : BEQ ..NoRound				;>Y can only be #$00 to #$02
	CPY #$01 : BEQ ..RoundedEmpty				;>comment line if you want to allow round towards to empty (left end is no longer mandatory to be enabled)
	CPY #$02 : BEQ ..RoundedFull				;>comment line if you want to allow round towards full (right end is no longer mandatory to be enabled)
	;BRA ..NoRound						;>remove comment if any above gets commented so following code doesn't inadvertently gets executed

	..RoundedEmpty
	if !Default_LeftPieces != 0
		LDA <font color="red">#$04</font>					;[*]left end
	else
		LDA <font color="red">#$09</font>					;[*]first middle byte/8x8
	endif
	STA !Scratchram_GraphicalBar_FillByteTbl		;/(remember, the table contains index numbers for tile numbers, not tile numbers directly!!)
	BRA ..NoRound						;>and done
	
	..RoundedFull
	if !Default_RightPieces != 0
		LDA <font color="red">#$04</font>					;[*]right end
	else
		LDA <font color="red">#$0A</font>					;[*]last middle byte/8x8
	endif
	STA !Scratchram_GraphicalBar_FillByteTbl+(!GraphiBar_LeftTileExist+(!GraphiBar_MiddleTileExist*!Default_MiddleLength)+!GraphiBar_RightTileExist)-1</pre></td></table>
^Please excuse the if statement, it's because it varies depending if you have the left/right parts enabled, due to the fact it is possible to have rounded to complete on the middle
section as well.<br><br>

Those colored in red fonts numbers indicate what item on the tile table mentioned previously (like an &ldquo;index&rdquo;), they should be a value that picks a number from the table located <b>after</b> the last
tile number (picks a number greater than the value that would represent full, so 3/3 full, you use #$04 as index). Same thing goes to the right end
but when rounded to full instead. If your bar does not have any ends, you include the near-rounded for the middle 8x8s. Do note that having both ends disabled means you have <b>both</b>
near-empty and near-full tile numbers appended after the last tile number (that indicates full 8x8 (individually)), in this example, #$09 and #$0A are for near-empty and near-full (order mentioned
correspond). For easy understanding, here is what I mean:<br>
